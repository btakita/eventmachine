  s.description = <<-EOD
EventMachine implements a fast, single-threaded engine for arbitrary network
communications. It's extremely easy to use in Ruby. EventMachine wraps all
interactions with IP sockets, allowing programs to concentrate on the
implementation of network protocols. It can be used to create both network
servers and clients. To create a server or client, a Ruby program only needs
to specify the IP address and port, and provide a Module that implements the
communications protocol. Implementations of several standard network protocols
are provided with the package, primarily to serve as examples. The real goal
of EventMachine is to enable programs to easily interface with other programs
using TCP/IP, especially if custom protocols are required.

# # The tasks and external gemspecs we used to generate binary gems are now
# # obsolete. Use Patrick Hurley's gembuilder to build binary gems for any
# # desired platform.
# # To build a binary gem on Win32, ensure that the include and lib paths
# # both contain the proper references to OPENSSL. Use the static version
# # of the libraries, not the dynamic, otherwise we expose the user to a
# # runtime dependency.
# 
# =begin
# # To build a binary gem for win32, first build rubyeventmachine.so
# # using VC6 outside of the build tree (the normal way: ruby extconf.rb,
# # and then nmake). Then copy rubyeventmachine.so into the lib directory,
# # and run rake gemwin32.
